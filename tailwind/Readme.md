# Exploring mars

Using NASA's open API's we are bringing mar's exploration for everybody. All NASA apis can be found on https://api.nasa.gov/ site.

This API is designed to collect image data gathered by NASA's Curiosity, Opportunity, and Spirit rovers on Mars and make it more easily available to other developers, educators, and citizen scientists. This API is maintained by Chris Cerami.

The documentation of the API can be found on github [here](https://github.com/chrisccerami/mars-photo-api)
